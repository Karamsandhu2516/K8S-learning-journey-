# Limitrange: It ensures that POD is using the only allocated resouces. e.g CPU and Memory should not be overused by POD with LimitRange Tag.
# ResourceQuota: It set the total limit on resources on in a NS.
# NodeSelector: It forces a Pod to run only on a Node that has a specific label.
# NodeAffinity: 
# PODoversize: Pod that asks for resources larger than what any single Node can provide, often used to demonstrate a scheduling failure.
# Priority_Pod: It assign a priority to the POD the higher prioriry POD runs first
# podschedulerreadiness: This allows you to say that a Pod is not ready to be considered for scheduling until a specific external condition is met.
